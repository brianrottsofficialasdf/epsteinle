      "text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy. Chlorophyll in the leaves absorbs sunlight while carbon dioxide enters through tiny pores called stomata. Water absorbed by the roots combines with carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen. This process forms the foundation of most food chains on Earth.",
